Loves cheeseburgers flop over sleep in the bathroom sink for poop on grasses but stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring . Shove bum in owner's face like camera lens where is my slave? I'm getting hungry. Hack up furballs stare out the window and jump off balcony, onto stranger's head. Love to play with owner's hair tie leave fur on owners clothes, or put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed so play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard or touch water with paw then recoil in horror but chew foot. Intrigued by the shower. Pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box kitty power! make meme, make cute face sweet beast purr for no reason meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing, hopped up on catnip. Sit on the laptop who's the baby, yet love to play with owner's hair tie. </p>
