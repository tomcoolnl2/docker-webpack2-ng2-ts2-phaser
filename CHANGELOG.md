Be aware of small bugs in Ng-Material.
If you get errors in the Material module, check out this issue I made in the Material Github repo (and it's resolution).
I expect this issue to be fixed in the next Material build.

About AoT compilation:
The "npm run build" command first compiles the application into the "compiled/" folder.<br>
Webpack production configuration uses this build instead of your source-code. <bR>
This way Webpack will use the compiled application.<br>
You can start a compilation manually by issuing "npm run aot"
